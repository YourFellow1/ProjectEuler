/**
 * Non-abundant Sums
 * Perfect number = sum of its proper divisors is equal to the number itself.
 * 
 * deficient number = sum of its proper divisors is less than the number itself.
 * abundant number = sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.
 * 
 * 
 * lowest limit of the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. because 12 is smallest.
 * 
 * upper limit is 28123. because 28123 is the largest number that can't be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. For some reason.
 * 
 * Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
